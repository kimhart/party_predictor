    "\n",
    "**This notebook is a record of the research done to create the party prediction algorithm.** The work will be split into sections which will discuss data collection, cleaning, modeling, vizualizing, and raw code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The party predictor will categorize a person a person into a political party and ideology by asking the user a series of questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How:** The party predictor uses probability theory and the k nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN). A probability for each political party and ideology is assigned based on user responses. The probabilies are applied to a two-dimensional space, where the political party is at the y-axis, and the political ideology is at the x-axis. The spectrum for each axis mimics the left wing vs right wing, and is determined by comparing the most extreme polarizing points of view. For example, the x-axis is the largest probability of being conservative subtracted by the largest probability of being liberal. The y-axis is the largest probability of being republican subtracted by the largest probability of being democratic. Finally, dummy data is created to represent each of the nine possible combinations (three political parties with three political ideologies). The party predictor categorises uses the probabilities from each question to create a point in the two-dimensional space, and uses kNN to find which of the nine political combinations the user's point is closest to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:** Now that the python work has been done I need to wait to set up the database before I transfer this code to a .py script. If I try to create a .py script before the database is created then I might need to do double work (depending on if the db structure changes).\n",

    "- Data Collection: \n",
    "    - All data is based on reserach done by the pew center. Each question includes a link to the source.\n",
    "        - information about the research can be found here: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/about-the-surveys-25/\n",
    "- Data Cleaning:\n",
    "    - A function is used to assign probabilies based on a user's answers.\n",
    "- Modeling:\n",
    "    - Create an answer set for each political party and ideology.\n",
    "    - The the premade answer sets to create the spectrums for the x/y-axis.\n",
    "    - Create data set for nine political party/ideology combinations.\n",
    "    - The model used is k nearest neighbors. This model assigns a political party and ideology by comparing the distance of the user's answer to the nine possible party/ideogology combinations.\n",
    "    - Create sample answers to test in the algorithm.\n",
    "- Vizualizing:\n",
    "    - The nine political party/ideology combinations and user's party/ideology is plotted to show how the categorization is working."
